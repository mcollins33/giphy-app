I used html, css, BootStrap, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, and JSON to create this app.  This app interacts with the Giphy API to retrieve gifs of princesses.  You can add buttons to view other princesses.  You can click on the images to animate them.

There were two things I found challenging in this assignment.  The first was the placement of the ratings above the images and getting the images to wrap.  I ended up creating a div for each rating/image and then floating the divs left.

The second challenge, because the divs were created using a for loop, was saving the still and animate urls for later use.  I ended up adding these as attributes to the div so that I could refer to them later.
